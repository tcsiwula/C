If temp is created inside Create_node() it exists on the stack and is destroyed from memory when the funciton ends. So if you malloc it then it will be saced on the heap, avoiding the segmentation fault.

Also by changing temp from struct to a struct* allows it to be stored on the heap and properly malloced inside Create_node().

Consequently the way you assign temp needs to be changed from struc.var to struct->var notation because it is a struct pointer now and not a struct.

You also need to return the temp* with out the & in front of it because it is already a pointer.
